The local health clinic is administering this vaccine, but the waiting line is very long.<br>For safety reasons, people are not allowed to stand very close to each other as the flu is not under control yet. However, many people were not aware of this precaution. A health and safety official recently examined the line and has determined that people need to spread out more in the line so that they are at least T units away from each other. This needs to be done as quickly as possible so we need to calculate the minimum distance D such that it is possible for every person to move at most D units so the distance between any two people is at least T. Specifically, D should be the minimum value such that there are locations x'i so that |xi - x'i| <= D for each person i and |x'i - x'j| >= T for any two distinct people i,j. Furthermore, since nobody can move past the receptionist we must also have that x'i >= 0.<br>The location of each person is given by the number of meters they are standing from the receptionist. When spreading out, people may move either forward or backward in line but nobody may move past the location of the receptionist.<br><h4>Input</h4>The first line of input contains a single integer K <= 30 indicating the number of test cases to follow.

But, what they fail to realize is that their power is their normalcy, theability to think, rationalize and then act.But, they do have an additional power... Greyjoys like Theon - who are normal, can figure out if aperson is a traitor or not. And they need to use their power to a great extent.In an array, which consists of N elements, A1, A2, ..., AN, if a subarray has the total number of distinctelements as that of the original array, that determines the presence of a traitor.You've to help the Greyjoys in figuring out the total number of subarrays having totalnumber of distinct elements same as that of the original array.Input format:First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. The next T line of the input will consist of asingle integer N followed by N integers A1, A2, ... , AN.Output format: Output the answer to the problem.<h4>SAMPLE INPUT</h4><code>5<br>1 2 2 1 1<br></code><h4>SAMPLE OUTPUT</h4><code>8<br></code><h4>Explanation</h4>All the possible subarrays are [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [1,5], [2,4], [2,5], [3,4], [3,5]<h4>Test Case</h4><code>30<br>121232  861456 378932 9657832 9657832 2496678 378932 861456 7433889 10121014 7433889 62628 4999643 4999543 10121014 2496678 378932 378932 861456 10121014 861456 9657832 378932 4999643 121232 62628 598765 861456 9657832 378932<br></code>",
 	19: "Euron and his friend Theon have started painting a wall. Euron is painting the wall red and Theon is painting it pink. You can consider the wall being made of a very large number of bricks, numbered 1, 2, 3 and so on.<br>Euron has the following scheme of painting: he skips xâ€‰-â€‰1 consecutive bricks, then he paints the x-th one. That is, he'll paint bricks x, 2Â·x, 3Â·x and so on red. Similarly, Theon skips yâ€‰-â€‰1 consecutive bricks, then he paints the y-th one. Hence he'll paint bricks y, 2Â·y, 3Â·y and so on pink.<br>After painting the wall all day, the boys observed that some bricks are painted both red and pink. Euron has a lucky number a and Theon has a lucky number b. Boys wonder how many bricks numbered no less than a and no greater than b are painted both red and pink. This is exactly your task: compute and print the answer to the question. <br><h4>Input</h4>The input will have a single line containing four integers in this order: x, y, a, b. <h4>Output</h4>Output a single integer â€” the number of bricks numbered no less than a and no greater than b that are painted both red and pink.<br><h4>Sample Input</h4><code>2 3 6 18</code><h4>Sample Output</h4><code>3</code><h4>Test Case</h4><code>10 15 69 195610342<br></code>",
 	20: "Last week, Yara learned about a new type of equations in her math class called Modular Equations. Lets define i modulo j as the remainder of division of i by j. A Modular Equation, as Yara's teacher described, is an equation of the form a mod x = b in which a and b are two non-negative integers and x is a variable. We call a positive integer x for which a solution of our equation.<br>Yara didn't pay much attention to the class since she was watching a movie. She only managed to understand the definitions of these equations.<br>Now she wants to write her math exercises but since she has no idea how to do that, she asked you for help. She has told you all she knows about Modular Equations and asked you to write a program which given two numbers a and b determines how many answers the Modular Equation a mod x = b has.<br><h4>Input</h4>In the only line of the input two space-separated integers a and b are given.<br><h4>Output</h4>If there is an infinite number of answers to our equation, print 'infinity' (without the quotes). Otherwise print the number of solutions of the Modular Equation a mod x = b.<br><h4>Sample Input</h4><code>9435152 272<br></code><h4>Sample Output</h4><code>282</code><h4>Test Case</h4><code>233758336 10665466</code>"
